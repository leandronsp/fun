# Eulerglot

In this project I show problems at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and solve them using different languages.

- Ruby
- Elixir
- Clojure
- Javascript


#####Disclaimer

The intent of this project is to explore different technical solutions across different languages for learning purpose. **Please do NOT open the solutions** unless you've already solved them. 

Each file is named using the Euler's ID prefix.
